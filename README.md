## About

First settled in 1788, Cincinnati is one of the oldest American cities west of the original colonies. Today, the 
city struggles with aging home stock, stifling economic redevelopment in some neighborhoods. 

DSSG is working with the City of Cincinnati to identify properties at risk of code violations or abandonment. We hope
that early intervention strategies can prevent further damage and stimulate neighborhood revitalization. Read more about
our project [here](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/2000/03/04/org-cincinnati.html).
